## DAY 1 - SSH

<h4>SSH or secure shell is a protocol.SSH is a way for machines to communicate with one another.</h4>

1) For example Hypertext Transfer Protocol allows you to send files over the internet.
just like HTTP SSH is another protocol that allows us to communicate
between two computers over the Internet.
2) It allows users to share files as well as control and modify remote computers over the internet.

3) It was created as a secure way of communication which again encrypts all data so bad actors can't monitor

4) A shell needs a certain protocol to enable data exchange or communication between two devices and not
just a browser and a server and that's why SSH is called secure shell protocol.

5) It's a protocol to use over shell and if you remember a shell unlike a browser allows you to talk to
the operating system yes you've used your command line before right.

6) The significant advantage offer by SSH over its predecessors is the use of encryption to ensure
secure transfer of information between host and the client.The host refers to the remote server you're trying to access while the client is the computer you're
using to access the host.
    
        ssh {user}@{host}
    <p><b>ssh -</b> SSH key command and instruct your system that you want to open an encrypted secure
          shell connection.</p>
    <p><b>user -</b> user represents the account you want to access.For example you may want to access the root user which is basically synonymous for system an administrator.</p>
    <p><b>host -</b> Host refers to the computer you want to access.</p>
    
7) Once you are enter into your ubuntu box . Run below commands
    
        ssh root@ip
        sudo apt-get install git // it will install git
        git clone repo
        sudo apt install curl
        curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo bash -
        sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
        sudo apt-get install -y npm
        exit // to logout of the box
        
8) Sending local folder data to server
        
        cd folderName
        rsync -av . root@ip:~/destinationFolder eg rsync -av . root@167.99.146.57:~/destination
        ssh root@ip
        ls // it will show the folder with the data that you have copied
        
9) Rsync (Remote Sync) is a most commonly used command for copying and synchronizing files and directories remotely as well as locally in Linux/Unix systems.
    
        rsync options source destination
        
## DAY 2
### How SSH Works
  
  <h4>1) Symmetrical Encryption</h4>
     <p>symmetric encryption uses one secret key for both the encryption and decryption by both parties.And SSH communicates through this shared key. But if anyone hack this key he can decrypt the data. So, we need to secure this key using key exchange algorithm a secure way to exchange these keys. In this two computers share public pieces of data and then manipulate it to independently calculate the key</p>
  <h4> Asymmetrical Encryption</h4>
  <p>symmetrical encryption uses two separate keys(public and private) for encryption and decryption. Public you can share with anybody.Now these public keys are linked with the private key in terms of functionality. The private key cannot mathematically compute from the public key. The message encrypt by the public key is only decrypt by its own private key.</p>
  <p>Public key is generated by the Diffie Hellman key exchange method. So inshort we generate the symmetric key using asymmetrical encryption using the Diffie Hellman key exchange.</p>
  <p><h6>Diffie-Hellman</h6> It is an algorithm used to establish a shared secret between two parties. It is primarily used as a method of exchanging cryptography keys for use in symmetric encryption algorithms like AES. </p>
  <h4>Hashing</h4>
  <p>It is another form of cryptography used in secure shell connections.They simply generate a unique value of a fixed length for each input.</p>
  <p>Using a hash function each message that is transmitted must contain a something called Mac and this Mac is a hash generated from the symmetric key.The packet sequence number and the message contents that were sent.</p>  
   <p>let clientData = "abc"</p>
   <p>let symmetric key = 'xyz'</p>
   <p>after clientData + packet sequence number + symmetric key ---hashing---> "kjhkjkjlkj"</p>
    <p>Now host will having the same symmetric key + packet sequence number when they do hasing it generate the same hash code</p>
    
   <p>To genrate public and private key run below command</p>
        
        ssh-keygen -C "youremailid"
        pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa_digitalocean.pub
        ls -a (to see hidden files)
        
###### Windows: 
If you have Git for Windows (which you should), ssh-keygen command should be available: https://gitforwindows.org/
You can read more about this here
Another option is to use https://www.ssh.com/ssh/putty/windows/puttygen
      
      
### setup ssh for github
1) generate the key 
        
        ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "karkra.nikhil@gmail.com"

2) copy the key 
 
       pbcopy < ~/.ssh/nik-github.pub
       
3) add the key
       
       ssh-add ~/.ssh/github_rsa
       
4) go to github account ---> settings ---> go to  SSH keys & GPG key --> add new SSH --->paste your key that you have copied and save.
